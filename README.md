# Accountability Ladder

## Getting Started

**Goals for this Accountability Ladder:** To protect the integrity of our community by having a set of standards outlining proper practices to deal with code of conduct violations at conferences and in open source communities.  Our hope is that it will help secure a safe and inclusive space for everyone.

## The Ladder: Level 1 to Level 4

**Note:** This should not be a replacement for judgment. The intent of person also matters greatly.  If you have earned several bans within a year and show the inability or unwillingness to change, then the next ban becomes longer up to banned for life.  

### Level 1 - Verbal offenses
Violations include but are not limited to:

- Offensive “jokes” or pranks that are hostile or demeaning with regard to race, gender, color, religion, national origin, age, or disability 
- Aggressively pushing your own services, products or causes 
- Being disruptive 
- Microaggressions - Everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target person(s) based solely upon their marginalized group membership. 
- Pattern (3 or more) of offhand comments that create atmospheres that are not productive - emojis, comments, or attitudes that are consistently perceived as *negative and unproductive* within in the community that may or may not be targeted directly at any one person. 

**Consequence:** Warning and given literature on how to be an ally. 

**Rehabilitation:** Read literature on how to be an ally.  

### Level 2
Violations include but are not limited to:

- Repeat a level one violations within 1 year 
- Continued requests to go on a date after the person has declined
- Not respecting personal boundaries even after they have been communicated.  This can be in time or information too.   
- Displaying sexualized images in public spaces 
  - I.e. the sponsors at a conference should not have sexualized images on the flyers 

**Consequence:** Not welcome for 3 months from incident

**Rehabilitation:** A quiz on what you have learned from the reading and an appropriate online training. 

### Level 3 - Physical offenses and sexual harassment 
Violations include but are not limited to:

- Level 2 violation after warning within a year
- Unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention
- Harassing photography or recording 
- Nude sexualized images 
- Intimidation and/or abuse of power 
- Working outside a previously defined governance structure to force someone to do something that makes them uncomfortable or compromises their integrity 


**Consequence:** Not welcome for 6 - 12 months from incident based on severity of the incident.  Work or school can be notified depending on circumstances.  

**Rehabilitation:** The perpetrator needs to ask the adult version of “How can I help?” and take ownership to come up with an agreement with the committee to make things right with the victim.  Then the perpetrator needs to report back on what happened.   


### Level 4 - Criminal conduct (whether or not a criminal case is prosecuted)
Violations include but are not limited to:

- Physical or sexual assault 
- Verbal threats or demands -threatening physical harm, blackmail (if you don’t do this, then I will somehow threaten your personal or professional life) 
- Stalking - a course of conduct directed at a specific person that involves repeated (two or more occasions) visual or physical proximity, non-consensual communication, or verbal, written, or implied threats, or a combination thereof, that would cause a reasonable person fear. (definition from the DOJ)
- Theft
- Harassing photography or recording
- Injecting malware into the repo or unpublishing packages that others depend on
- Malware - is defined as something that is dangerous, violates privacy and not merely annoying 

In any of the following circumstances, the person in charge should turn over the appropriate information to the police.  Do not try to deal with it yourself.  Work or school is notified.  

**Consequence:** Involve law enforcement and suggest violator be banned for life.

**Rehabilitation:**  If rehabilitation makes sense in these cases and the perpetrator is not banned for life then the perpetrator and the committee should work together to determine an appropriate plan.  Then when it is completed the perpetrator should report back in order to apply to be allowed back into the community.
